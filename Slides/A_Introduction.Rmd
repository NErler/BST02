## What is this Course About

\blue{Statistics} have flourished in the recent years mainly due to the possibility of doing complex analysis using computers

* Many statistical software exist to do simple and specialized analysis
    
\vspace*{0.5cm}    

The \blue{programming language R} is popular for data scientists

* Analysts must not only learn how to use the software but also the ideas behind it
* Learning statistical modelling and algorithm is more important than learning a programming language.

## What is R

* **R** is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics
  - extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods

* **R** is mainly used in academia. However, many large companies also use **R** programming language, including healthcare industries but also Uber, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on

* Unlike SPSS, **R** is purely command driven
  

## A brief history of R

* **1993**: University of Auckland, New Zealand by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
* **1997**: R core Team was formed (20 members)
* **2000**: R 1.0.0 released
* **2004**: First international user conference in Vienna
* **2013**: 5026 packages available
* **2017**: 10875 packages available
* **Now**: \texttt{\blue{nrow(available.packages())}}


## Why learn R ?

* **R** is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
* It compiles and runs on LINUX, Windows and MacOS
* Open source language
* Users are allowed to modify and redistribute the code
* Advanced statistical language
* Supports extensions
* Related to other languages
* **Flexible and fun!**
  

## Where do I get R ?
  - http://cran.r-project.org
  - choose your platform, e.g., Windows, Linux
  - e.g., for Windows: Windows $\rightarrow$ base $\rightarrow$ Download R 3.6.2 for Windows
  - Install . . .
  
  
## How does R work ?

  - Packaged built for specific tasks
  - Download R packages from the CRAN web site $\rightarrow$ within R
    + Packages
    + Install package(s) . . .
    + make you choice(s)
    + load the package using \textcolor{blue}{library()} (\textcolor{red}{note}: install does not mean load)
    
    
## How to get help in R

* Within R 
  - \textcolor{blue}{help.search("topic")} or \textcolor{blue}{??"topic"} (depends on the installed packages)
  - \textcolor{blue}{RSiteSearch("topic")} (requires internet connection)
  - \textcolor{blue}{help()} or \textcolor{blue}{?} invoke the on-line help file for the specified function
  - checking the FAQ
* Online
  - R-help (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help – mailing list)
  - R-seek (http://www.rseek.org – Google-like searched engine)
  - CRAN Task Views (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ – categorization of packages)
  - Crantastic (http://crantastic.org/ – categorization of packages + reviews)
  - R4stats (http://www.r4stats.com/ – examples of basic R programs)
  - R related Blogs (http://www.r-bloggers.com/ – many useful illustrations of R and R packages)
  - Open community for developers (https://stackoverflow.com/ – ask/answer a question)

## Disadvantages of R

* Appears intimidating to the first-time user
* Output is not so nice looking (but there are some alternatives)
* Exporting output is more difficult
* Cannot easily handle very big data sets (depends on the installed RAM)
* A lot of things are available but it is sometimes hard to find your way
* The quality of the available packages is greatly varying
* Has been criticized for using only one CPU at a time (but the parallel packages helps you perform tasks in different cores)

## Summary

* **R** is a great tool to explore and investigate the data
* Several statistical methods can be performed with **R**
* It is important to understand the methods before applying them in **R**

\begin{block}{How to use}
\textbf{R} uses packages that perform specific tasks
\begin{itemize}
\item Install package only once
\item Load package every time you open \textbf{R}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
