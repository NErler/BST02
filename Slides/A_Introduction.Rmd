## What is this Course About

* Statistics have flourished in the recent years mainly due to the possibility of doing complex analysis using computers

* The most valuable tool of a modern quantitative researcher is his/her personal computer
  - Many statistical software exist to do simple and specialized analysis

* Analysts must not only learn how to use the software but also the ideas behind it


## What is this Course About (cont’d)

Therefore, the aim of this course is:

* **Aim A**: General Introduction
  - how does the programming language **R** work
* **Aim B**: Basic use of **R**
  - getting started with a data set, data visualizations
* **Aim C**: Programming
  - using and writing functions, popular functions which you will later need for the more advanced courses such as Repeated **Measurements (CE08)**, **Bayesian Statistics (CE09)**, etc.
* **Aim D**: Statistics with **R**
  - basic statistical tests, regression analysis 
* **Aim E**: tools
  - some interesting tools for reporting data analyses in a reproducible manner

## What is R

  - is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
  - Unlike SPSS, R is purely command driven
  

## A brief history of R

* **1993**: University of Auckland, New Zealand by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
* **1997**: R core Team was formed (20 members)
* **2000**: R 1.0.0 released
* **2004**: First international user conference in Vienna
* **2013**: 5026 packages available
* **2017**: 10875 packages available
  
  
## Why learn R ?

* R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
* It compiles and runs on LINUX, Windows and MacOS
* Open source language
* Users are allowed to modify and redistribute the code
* Advanced statistical language
* Supports extensions
* Related to other languages
* **Flexible and fun!**
  

## Where do I get R ?
  - http://cran.r-project.org
  - choose your platform, e.g., Windows, Linux
  - e.g., for Windows: Windows $\rightarrow$ base $\rightarrow$ Download R 3.6.2 for Windows
  - Install . . .
  
  
## How does R work ?

  - Packaged built for specific tasks
  - Download R packages from the CRAN web site $\rightarrow$ within R
    + Packages
    + Install package(s) . . .
    + make you choice(s)
    + load the package using \textcolor{blue}{library()} (\textcolor{red}{note}: install does not mean load)
    
    
## How to get help in R

* Within R 
  - \textcolor{blue}{help.search("topic")} or \textcolor{blue}{??"topic"} (depends on the installed packages)
  - \textcolor{blue}{RSiteSearch("topic")} (requires internet connection)
  - \textcolor{blue}{help()} or \textcolor{blue}{?} invoke the on-line help file for the specified function
  - checking the FAQ
* Online
  - R-help (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help – mailing list)
  - R-seek (http://www.rseek.org – Google-like searched engine)
  - R-wiki (http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php)
  - CRAN Task Views (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ – categorization of packages)
  - Crantastic (http://crantastic.org/ – categorization of packages + reviews)
  - Equalis (http://www.equalis.com/forums/ – R forum)
  - R4stats (http://www.r4stats.com/ – examples of basic R programs)
  - R related Blogs (http://www.r-bloggers.com/ – many useful illustrations of R and R packages)


## Disadvantages of R

* appears intimidating to the first-time user
* output is not so nice looking (but there are some alternatives)
* exporting output is more difficult
* cannot easily handle very big data sets (depends on the installed RAM)
* a lot of things are available but it is sometimes hard to find your way
* the quality of the available packages is greatly varying
