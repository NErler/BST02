# Notes

* Explain difference between `Error`, `Warning` and `Message`?
* In which part do we practice with logical operators (`&`, `|`, `&&`, `==`, ...)? (Elrozy: `&`, `|`, `==`)
* What about contrasts? `contr.treatment` etc. (Nicole)

## Part B
### Data Structures
* add `factor` and `ordered`? (Elrozy add factor, Nicole ordered in statistical models)
* arrays?
* operator `^`? It is there.

### Data Transformations
* maybe we shouldn't refer to "outliers" but "extreme values" or "values in a range of interest" (Elrozy: change outliers to a range of values)

### Data Exploration
* `percent()` is not a function (add package as note)

## Part C: Functions
### Functions for exploring data
* Have the students already practiced subsetting in Part B? Yes
* Should `subset()` go into Part B (subsetting) or Part C (functions)? Part C
* Do we really need the matrix algebra? No
* Add a section for creating objects (`matrix`, `data.frame`, ...)
* For practical "Summarizing Data" students need to know the functions `factor()`, 
  `sqrt()` and `^`. Nicole: `sqrt()` need to be explained in Functions
* Not yet in practical for data exploration:
  Correlation, covariance, duplicates, function `ave()`
